# renderer
Hope to make a robust renderer using both ray tracing and rasterization, with modern development workflow

~~Rewrite is better than refactor~~

## Third Party Softwares

- [Tev](https://github.com/Tom94/tev). In this project, the released executable files will be an optional real time viewer for rendering result.
